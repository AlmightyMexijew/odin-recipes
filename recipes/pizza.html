        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul><li>Dough- made from 1 1/2 cups water and 3 3/4 cups flour mixed together</li>
            <li>Yeast- 1 package of yeast, usually 2 - 2 1/4 teaspoons</li>
            <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil- 2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>Salt- 2 teaspoons</li>
            <li>Sugar- 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Sauce- 1/2 cup of tomato basil sauce</li>
            <li>Cheese- 4 kinds: Fontina, Parmesan, Mozarella, Feta- to taste. No less than 8 ounces per cheese, preferably more.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps to make the pizza</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make mixture of yeast and bowl of warm water</li>
            <li>Let it sit for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Add flour,salt,sugar,and olive oil together</li>
            <li>Stir dough in the bowl for approximately 7-10 minutes until consistency is sticky to the touch</li>
            <li>Shake dough out to a clean surface, coat bowl with olive oil, then return dough inside to sit for 1 1/2 hours covered in a warm place.</li>
            <li>After dough has risen divide it according to your baking dish requirements. If you are baking a single pizza you do not need to divide it, however if you are making multiple pizzas you will need to make sure you have enough between them.</li>
            <li>Dust your hands with flour. Uncover the dough and make it into a ball. <em>For multiple pizzas you will have multiple balls of dough</em></li>
            <li>Let the ball(s) sit for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flatten the ball(s) on lightly flour-covered surface. Your goal here is to flatten and stretch the dough to the size of your baking tray.  <em><strong>Keep in mind that deeper pizzas require more dough and will have less stretch to give in the process.</strong></em> We want to have a fairly even distribution around the baking tray.</li>
            <li>Pinch the edges to form a crust. If you wish to stuff it, this is where you place your stuffing in a thin row on the border of the pizza before rolling inward toward the center.</li>
            <li>Press lightly around making dents to prevent bubbling.</li>
            <li>Spread the cheese around in <em>uniform layers</em> to make things even. Don't go too crazy or it will get soggy.</li>
            <li>Slide into oven and bake at 475*F. Your goal is to aim for melted cheese and golden crust color. This takes approximately <strong>10 to 15 minutes</strong>.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and place somewhere to cool. Eat when you feel like it. Enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
