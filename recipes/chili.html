        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Mama's chili is the best chili ever. On a cold windy day there will always be room for Mama's chili.</p>
        <p>Even on a hot summer day, it goes great with <em>una cerveza</em>, a beer and some fresh cornbread or tortilla.</p>
        <h2>So what does mama put in there anyway? Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul><strong>Here are a list of must-have ingredients:</strong>
            <li>Beans. You must have at least 3 kinds of beans. <strong>I'm serious.</strong> The best kind would be kidney beans, black beans, and kidney beans.</li>
            <li>Chili pepper. Diced up fine. Preferably dried but fresh does the trick.</li>
            <li>Garlic. Lots of garlic. If your house doesn't smell like Gilroy,California you are doing something wrong! </li>
            <li>Masa. You can substitute oatmeal or wheat flour if you cannot find this special corn flour.</li>
            <li>Four diced tomatoes <strong>or</strong> 2 cans of tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Spicy paprika.</li>
            <li>Sweet paprika.</li>
            <li>Cumin.</li>
            <li>Meat. Any cut will do so long as they are bite-sized chunks.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2> Steps:</h2>
    <ol>These are the steps to making Mama's Chili:
        <li>Get a big pot.</li>
        <li>Soak your beans in the pot for 8 hours under cover of water.</li>
        <li>Pour out the water while retaining the beans.</li>
        <li>Fill the pot with water until about 80% submerged.</li>
        <li>Toss in the chili pepper. If you are using crushed or powdered chili then throw about 2 Tbsp in.</li>
        <li>Toss in garlic. Preferably use fresh cloves but powder is also okay.</li>
        <li>Toss in Tbsp of each paprika, and 2 Tbsp. of Cumin.</li>
        <li>Toss in tomatoes or tomato products.</li>
        <li>Toss in meat.</li>
        <li>Toss in half Tbsp of Masa.</li>
        <li>Heat, covered, on high for an hour with only enough air to prevent bubbling.</li>
        <li>After an hour, reduce heat to simmer and cover fully</li>
        <li>Stir every 10 minutes for the next hour until texture and density is sauce-like. Add water or masa as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve in bowls with tortilla, add cheese if you desire, and crack yourself a beer. <strong>you earned it.</strong></li>
