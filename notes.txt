This space is where notes made during the process of creation will be created.
I will do my best to maintain details according to changes/times.

--commit--

--commit--

Phase 3/ Interation 3
Meant to establish page content
Order of image, description, ingredients, steps
*image == https://i.redd.it/rdnx7gqhsmh61.jpg
(sidenote): This image displays incredibly large on our page and may be swapped out if we cannot find a solution.
*description: our description of what chili is (who doesn't like chili?!)
*ingredients: our unordered list (<ul> tag,<li> items)
*steps: our ordered list (<ol>tag,<li> items) how to make the chili

While adding items to the ul I looked at how other pages fit their pictures. With some minor research it was discovered that the size attributes would help.
Therefore, I set the picture's width and height to 500x500 and achieved a passable first commit level.
I also decided to add another heading size for the ingredients to define it better to the page.
